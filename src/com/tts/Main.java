}

//   INSTRUCTIONS:
//
//
//        Step Two: Implement Library
//        Next we need to build the class that will represent each library, and manage a collection of books. All libraries have the same hours: 9 AM to 5 PM daily. However, they have different addresses and book collections (i.e., arrays of Book objects).
//
//        Download the attached Library.java file. We provide a main method that creates two libraries, then performs some operations on the books. However, all the methods and member variables are missing. You will need to define and implement the missing methods. Read the main method and look at the compile errors to figure out what methods are missing.
//
//        Notes
//        Some methods will need to be static methods, and some need to be instance methods.
//        Be careful when comparing Strings objects. Use string1.equals(string2) for comparing the contents of string1 and string2.
//        You should get a small part working at a time. Start by commenting the entire main method, then uncomment it line by line. Run the program, get the first lines working, then uncomment the next line, get that working, etc.
//        You must not modify the main method.
